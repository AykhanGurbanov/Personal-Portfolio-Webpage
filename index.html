        <h1>Welcome to my Personal Portfolio Webpage</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm Aykhan Gurbanov. I was born in Azerbaijan and finished high school there. I always dreamed of living in Turkey, so I decided to pursue my bachelor's degree here. I was accepted into Yildiz Technical University, where I study Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering.

From my childhood, I have had an interest in coding. I was in my second year at university when I was first introduced to Python. Since then, I have been working on various projects to improve my skills in Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

In addition to my coursework, I completed my dissertation on data science in marine engineering. This project allowed me to combine my passion for coding with my academic focus, applying data science techniques to solve complex problems in the field of marine engineering.

Here, you can explore some of the projects I've worked on:
